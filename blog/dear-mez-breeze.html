<p>Dear Mez Breeze,</p>
<p>It is been long time. I turned 36 last week. This year also the 10th
year I am working professionally as software engineer. Ten years ago,
is also the time when I discovered your work. I remember in 2011, I
read "Program or be programmed" by Douglas Rushkoff, and "The Filter
Bubble" by Eli Pariser. Obama was president of the USA. I was trying
to translate "Culture and Empire" by Pieter Hintjens in french. My
domain name was something starting with hypermove, far fetched
reference to Oxmo Puccino song "On ne danse pas":</p>
<p>That was validated by Ox himself. It was the beginning of Google+. I
wanted to build a social network, reminiscent of my most popular
previous project on top of Neo4J(ava), with the help of Tinkerpop,
Gremlin, and my biggest time sink, and most dangerous programming
language: Python.</p>
<p>I wanted an hypercube as the logo for wanna-be my hypersocial
website. At the time, a socialite was defined by Google search engine
as the one that likes to share. That is how I stumbled upon
Augmentology blog. I remember that, not because I have giant memory. I
remember all of that because it all makes sense in my life. You,
explained a lot of the things I had doubt about. You were the concrete
realization of many of my dreams, and questioning answers commonly
accepted as truth. Even if you are noticeable and noticed, you take
positions that go unnoticed or silenced around me. It is or least part
of my education, partly influenced by various aspects of my life that
getting noticed is not a good thing. After all, my dream is a
continuous mesh of person with equals rights and opportunities where
any of them can enjoy freedom, fulfill their passion, and realize
their dreams. You have a Wikipedia page. That is where I discovered
about Mezangelle. Mezangelle made my mind, and my skills stronger.  A
Big Sister. Eventually there was hope. I crafted some lines myself,
even got encouragement by you and others.</p>
<p>I kept a sugared version of my favorite line:</p>
<blockquote><p>$ git commit --message="mezangelle: revert silence for a peaceful sanity"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I unleashed Mezangelle full steam hidden in a very common feature such
as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hliLVu79N98">an alias</a>: amz3. The
official explanation is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>amz3 is a compressed representation of a morph-syntactic
combinatorics transderivationnal search in a graphical semantic
space with the help of pattern matching that aggregates several
senses. The induced experience while reading it is a reference to
the Isaac Asimov novel «Little Lost Robot» in practice an obscure
form of poetry named Mezangelle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Karine and you were the ones that gave me the strength, courage and
desire to voice myself.</p>
<p><a href="https://xndxn.bandcamp.com/track/project-ion">Project-ion</a></p>
<p>What remains of that stream of thought is one question: "Should I
learn French?". A couple of month later, you requested a translation
of one piece I wrote and recorded. I did my best, and you told me that
it was great. It is not about you or for you. It is time to break the
spell. It is for nobody, and everybody in particular. I was meant to
taunt. It is not perfect, I like it, even with the
imperfections. There is a particular imperfection, that I do not want
to take away, I was merely trying to voice some the infinite
meticulous poetry of Mezangelle. Any time I think about it, I remember
about you, Mez Breeze and the perfect deep drum of senses rhythm that
are spelled out in your Mezangelle. Your question about learning
french was impossible to answer.  "Choose you own destiny". And the
ever lasting question: For me? In fact, the last verses are a tribute
to Mezangelle. And even the last line can only start to make sense if
/ when you both know french and Mezangelle.</p>

own deed.</p>
<p>You may or may not have invented Mezangelle, maybe all Mezangelle is a
invention by you. My mother tongue and its associated history is a
lie. Still, you are the one that wield it when I needed it.</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>
